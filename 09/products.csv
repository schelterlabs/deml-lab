Kitchen	Keurig K450 Brewing System, Black	Love this coffee maker. I have had one of the original models for years and decided to upgrade and donated my old one to work.  The added features on the 400 series like the strong option and carafe are awesome.  The light in the reservoir is a cool bonus, works great as a night light.  Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review.
Jewelry	KONOV Men's Wide Stainless Steel Rubber Bangle Bracelet, Blue Silver	I ordered 3 pieces of jewelry from here and they all are great pieces. Only thing about this particular piece is that its just a tad bit too big but not big enough to slide off my wrist at any time.. so still a great piece!!

Kitchen	Bartelli Soft Edge Automatic Electric Can Opener - Blue	[[VIDEOID:70222cbf9d5b236177117b19f391038e]]After many years our electric can opener had died. We had a manual one as a backup, but we both had so much trouble trying to get it to work, that we tried another one.  My fiance can get the newer manual one to work but I can't, I have to squeeze so hard that it hurts my wrist.  When I saw that Bartelli was looking for reviewers of their Soft Edge Automatic Can Opener, I applied right away.<br /><br />Thankfully they selected me and provided me with an Amazon code to order the blue version for free.  When it arrived I quickly ran to the store to get some AAA batteries which are not included so I could test it out.<br /><br />At first I was making it out to be harder than it really was.  You simply mount the can opener on the can, press the button to turn on, let can opener swivel around the can, press the button again to turn off the can opener when it has made a complete circle.  Because the can stays flat on the counter, I don't have to worry about any contents spilling out, especially on larger cans like when I used a stand up electric can opener.<br /><br />I love that this design doesn't take up much space, and can be stored in a drawer.  Our counter  space is very limited so not having to plug this can opener in makes prepping meals at the kitchen table a  breeze.<br /><br />This product cuts around the side of the can to eliminate sharp and dangerous edges, creating an easily re-sealable lid with a smooth edge. That makes it easy to keep food covered while preparing a meal.<br /><br />This is perfect for those with carpal tunnel issues, arthritis or any other hand pain, as it requires no manual labor.
Jewelry	Charm.L Grace Jewelry Vintage Alloy Flowers Collar Necklace Earrings Set	On point
Jewelry	Gay Rainbow Sisters Gay Pride Leather Bracelet Wristlet	I like the fit and the colors. They are not faded. Its well made and I think its pretty durable. The only hing i dislike is the left over string where they finished tying it. It sticks out and the string is coming undone. It doesnt affect the bracelet though because it cant undo itself more than where they tied it.
Kitchen	"Vegetable Peeler, Ergonomic Pressure Absorbing Handle, Stainless Steel Blade, Modern Super ""Y"" Pro, Red"	This is the best vegetable peeler I have used so far. I like its handle...great design! I got the red one. It stands out among the black and stainless kitchen product I have. Above all, the blade is sharp and it peels really thin. Very happy with this product.
Kitchen	Biscuit Sheet	my second pan like this.  It has a lid that goes with it.
Jewelry	BodyJ4You Professional Body Piercing Kit (Belly Button,Tongue, Eyebrow, Nipple, Lip, Nose) 14G Needles	Everything was very well packages, and clean. However I got the wrong size needles! I got 16G needles with 14G rings. I could not do the piercing, I tried and it caused lists of pain from the different sizes.
Jewelry	JC128 Flower Earrings, Starfish Earrings, Faux Diamond Embellished Earrings	So cheaply made that the stones fell out before they even got to my house.

Kitchen	Inspired Basics Cast Iron Cleaner XL 8x6 Inch 316L Highest Grade Stainless Steel Cast Iron Skillet Cleaner	I just received this today and I did use it on one of my Lodge pans that was clean but had a few carbon pieces that had become part of the pan over the years. It very easily knocked those pieces off. I've been wanting some of this (or one of these) for a while but I find it easy enough to take care of cast iron without anything special. Depending on what you do with your pans though, sometimes nothing works as well as a specialized piece designed for that very purpose. Let me say though, I have never used one of these before nor have I ever seen or handled them anywhere else so I cannot say how this compares to the other pieces of chainmail on the market. So that being said, this is heavy duty, well put together and a good grade of stainless and as I said, it works... And it did something that I was going to have to use something like a chisel or perhaps a strong flat head screwdriver for (although I didn't want to take the chance of gouging the pan surface). There is merit to &#34;the right tool for the right job&#34;. I got this at a promotional price in exchange for an honest review (to be fair, they never said they expected a review of any kind so maybe &#34;in exchange&#34; is the wrong term but that's implied). Honestly, I do not think I would have purchased this otherwise even though I said I have wanted one, for a few reasons, one is my cast iron has been meticulously cared for and has a great no stick surface so clean up is a snap, and another is I don't really use the pans for let's say a scrambled egg and cheese casserole or something that has the potential to be that messy... That is where I could see something like this coming into its own and were that the case, I would be all over something such as this. And that's why the 4 stars rather than 5. For me, this is a very specialized utensil, and as of yet I don't really see any other use for it. If this hits the mark for you, then yes, 5 stars for the build and materials and the company. If I figure outanother use for this, I'll let you know. ***************** I just changed this from 4 to 5 stars, this thing is great for cleaning grill grates and also the grill ridges in a stove top griddle, as long as it's not coated with something like Teflon. Now this has multiple uses for me and that's the fifth star!
Kitchen	"12"" Latex Balloons"	balloons. they blow up. they dont defalte for a whil.e
Kitchen	Lakemint Zoodle Chef Vegetable Spiralizer with Recipe e-Book and Cleaning Brush	This is a great tool for fun veggies! I just received mine today, and already convinced my &#34;ewww...vegetables!&#34; kid to join me in zucchini and eggs for breakfast...and she LOVED them. Can't wait to try out other veggies. VERY easy clean-up, and small enough to drop in a drawer. I can foresee a very busy future for my Zoodle!

Kitchen	Rubbermaid 26073 Limited Edition Dishwasher Safe Pitcher, Red	It's a pitcher - it's solid and doesn't leak - no complaints!
Jewelry	Aiyaya Jewelry Vintage Grand Choker Rhinestones Fashion Necklace	Simply stunning! Being from South Louisiana, we attend a lot of formal Mardi Gras balls, Twelfth Night parties, Festival balls, etc.  This is the perfect piece of jewelry to dress up a simple formal or semi-formal gown. The necklace incorporates lots of colors and could really be paired with a multitude of things. I like big, chunky, glamorous jewelry, and this is definitely a stunner! I have a lot of my great grandmother's antique jewelry and this reminds me of something from the 1940's. The colors of the necklace remind me of the beaches of Cancun and the beautiful shades of blue waters and the yellow sunshine. It comes packaged in a red velvet drawstring bag. Mine came in with a stone missing, I assume from shipping, but I am working on getting it exchanged as I type. This is definitely not a cheap, lightweight piece! It is so much more than I expected and I was pleasantly surprised! I do not think you will be disappointed at all with this piece, especially for the price! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
Kitchen	12 Black Plastic Pour Spout Dust Cap Covers Universal Dust and Bug Protection	My husband is a bartender and does private events in addition to his job at the bar. I think of the &#34;small things&#34;...like keeping the dust out of the bottles with the pourers. He got the tyre of pourer spouts with the flaps for his bar, but the plastic black ones (w/o flaps) for home. These fit perfectly. Great price, serve their purpose well.

Jewelry	His & Her's 8MM/6MM Tungsten Carbide Celtic Knot Dragon Design Carbon Fiber Inlay Wedding Band Ring Set	Beautiful rings!  They fit and wear comfortably and engraving is clear.  Seller is great too, very communicative and helpful!  The only suggestion I have would be to try to center the engraving more in the middle of the band widths and a bit further away from the tungsten labeling on the inside of the rings.  For the price of the rings and engraving for both this is a great deal!
Jewelry	Long Necklace for Women Handcrafted Silver Tone Czech Glass Crystal Bead	Very pretty and elegant!

Kitchen	Taylor Precision Products Digital Refrigerator/Freezer Thermometer	Thermomenter is great to check my wine fridge, but it can't hang on the wooden racks, so I just stand it up.
Kitchen	Top Rated Bellemain Premium Quality Stainless Steel Lemon Squeezer with Silicone Handles	The best lemon squeezer I've ever used! Large enough to fit those monster-sized lemons, strong steel to give them a good squeeze, and small enough holes to not let those darn seeds through. I like the comfort of the handles too. Excellent product.
Jewelry	8MM Tungsten Carbide Men's Wedding Band Ring in Comfort Fit and Matte Finish Sizes 5 to 16	I bought this because the ring I ordered for my wedding was not going to be delivered in time for my wedding.  I considered cancelling my original one, which cost over $300 and keeping this $20 ring.  I was amazed by the weight, quality and comfort fit of this ring.  This is a solid piece of jewelry and manly looking.  I work a lot with my hands and although I only wore this ring for a few weeks, it was still in perfect condition when the other one arrived.  Very quick shipping also.  Couldn't have been more satisfied.  I told my wife I would wear this ring every year on my anniversary since this is the ring I wore on our wedding day.
Kitchen	Wagner Magnalite 5781 Aero-Thermal High Performance 1 Quart Cooking Saucepan with Lid	Perfection. The casting & finish quality are absolutely top notch, handle very comfortable and the bottom edge curvature makes cleaning easier.
Kitchen	FloridaBrands Plastic Ice Cube Tray - Color May Vary	We couldn't even use these, I threw them away. The ice would break into tiny shards rather than pop out like it's supposed to.
Jewelry	Bling Jewelry .925 Silver Natural Compressed Turquoise Leverback Earrings	Matches Bling's Lapis ring nicely. Love the color of the stone, it's a nice deep blue and the silver is nice quality. The earrings aren't too heavy, and I like that the scroll work covers it partially. Seems like a nice secure earring. I'm wearing them now and they are very comfortable.
Kitchen	Sato Cutting Board Holder Stand	Fits my cutting boards behind my kitchen sink.  My sink is on a corner, so it fills the space well.  Good use of storage for a small space there.
Kitchen	iSi Set of 3 Flexible Measuring Cups - 1	Ii love this set...I heat milk for my coffee in the microwave and just pour it into the metal carafe.  The other sizes are just as useful.  I will surely give it as presents to lucky folks.
Kitchen	Tovolo Twist-Lock Corn Holders - Set of 8	Some real thought went into these holders.  The overall length is 3 1/8 inches and the central spike is 1 1/4 inches.  The central spike extends beyond the screw.  Inserting them is simplicity itself.  Press the central spike into the cob, and then screw it in.  Holds the corn firmly until you're finished eating.  Then simply unscrew and remove.  Note that these are designed to work with corn that has been cut on both ends.  Longevitity is the only question, but these holders look and feel plenty sturdy.  Highly recommended.<br />(10/31/2017)  Here I am again. After two years of chomping these holders are still going strong with no issues whatsoever. I only use four as I gave the other four to a friend shortly after purchase.  As I said before, “Best I've Ever Used !!”

Kitchen	T-fal FR4049 Family Pro 3-Liter Oil Capacity Electric Deep Fryer with Stainless Steel Waffle, 2.6-Pound, Silver	I love it! The fries made with it are really good but not greasy. The only thing I don't like about this product is that it is a little bit noisy.

Jewelry	Unistyle Jewelry Vintage Mens Womens Leather Bracelet with String Beads Brown Adjustable Bangle	I am very impressed with how well this bracelet is made and I love how it looks around my wrist. It was made to perfectly compliment a man or women combining brown leather with silver gold and brown beads. It is adjustable with a knot that can be tightened or loosened and will fit wrist 7 to 9 inches. It arrived in a really nice black box that would make it a great gift idea. I received this product discounted in exchange for a honest and unbiased review.
Kitchen	Aerolatte Shaker and Cappuccino Art set	The shaker works fine.  I would like it much better if it had a cap/lid for storing without the fear of ants or moisture penetration.  The stencils are nice and work as advertised.  You can also purchase various other latte art stencils to round out your collection.
Kitchen	Cuisinart CEC-10 Egg Central Egg Cooker	Works great and does 10 eggs! Only downfall is some of the eggs ooze while cooking so cleanup is a bit more than I'd like.

Kitchen	Raw Sugar Cane Swizzle Sticks - Pack of 20	This is b less than one star..has no taste I could have got the same taste from a toothpick. .don't buy wasted my money
Kitchen	Keurig 2.0 K350 Brewing System - Black	This brewer provides many choices as far as cup sizes are concerned. That's a real plus for the selecting the tiny to the large. It also has the carafe that comes in handy when several people are drinking the same flavor. One drawback is that choices of flavors are restricted to cups with the Kuerig  logo. But we have found satisfactory flavored creamers that satisfy different preferences.<br />The reminder to change the filter is a good idea since maintenance is hard for me to keep track of.<br />The choice to brew tea and hot chocolate will probably be used as the weather turns cold and hot beverages are a real necessity.<br />The bottom line is that I really like this model much better than the older one that was used for several years.
Kitchen	Paderno World Cuisine Spiral Vegetable Slicer / Countertop-Mounted Plastic Spiralizer Basic incl. 3 Different Blades Made of Stainless Steel	Absolutely love this product! It slice/cuts very easily. clean up is simple and easy to wash and store.

I sure do and I loved them then, I’m glad to see them back now.<br /><br />These come in a set of two, black, which goes with everything and fits right over your head onto your neck.<br /><br />I don’t remember these being punk, I do remember as I said earlier than I loved them back then and do now, and it’s an easy addition to any outfit.<br /><br />I received this item at no cost in exchange for my honest opinion

Kitchen	Spiralizer 5-Blade Vegetable Slicer, Strongest-and-Heaviest Duty, Best Veggie Pasta & Spaghetti Maker for Low Carb/Paleo/Gluten-Free Meals, With 3 Exclusive Recipe eBooks	I've had the Spiralizer about a month and have used it many times with different vegetables.  Excellent zucchini or yellow squash pasta, but I think my favorite is what I call onion &#34;nests&#34;.  So much easier and healthier than regular onion rings.  Same with potato nests, or a mixture of potato and onion.  Yum!  Cleanup is also very easy.  So much better than a hand-held model.

Kitchen	Bento Box : Hello Kitty Sakura Fuji Sanrio Lunch Box Bento 2stage Belt	I just received my bento box & I am very happy! ^_^ The design is as pictured & it is a lot bigger than I thought it would be! It also has a really great seal so top & bottom fit perfectly. I only wish they made a matching bag to carry it with. :P
Kitchen	Surfer Street Sign Cutouts   (4/Pkg)	Very colorful! Went well w/ the rest of the Decor for My son's Surfer/beach themed High school grad party. However they were a bit &#34;flimsy&#34; I thgt it would have been a more firm cardboar.  When I tried to hang them(little hole punch on each end) it sagged in the middle. So instead I doublesided tape them to the walls etc for deco. But other than that looked great!
Kitchen	Granite Ware Canning Kits	This is a great value. Bonus: made in the USA so no worries that there might be lead or heavy metals hiding in the manufacture of this product.
Jewelry	FM42 6-Prongs 6mm Sparkling Clear Crystal Solitaire Engagement Style Ring R51 Size 6	This is a beautiful ring. I wear it everyday! Love the rose gold! I've washed my hands a few times with it on and the color hasn't faded (as of yet) and it doesn't make my had green. However, the prongs aren't really evenly spaced out, which bothers me a little. It's not really noticeable unless you really look at it.<br /><br />UPDATE: It's been a couple weeks now and I've noticed that some of the color has worn off. At least around the band, it's turned like regular gold instead of rose gold. The setting, where the diamond sits is still rose gold so the ring looks two-toned now...
Kitchen	Truefabrications Smartphone Flask, 4 Oz, Black	This product is a waste of money.  The stopper pops off when it has liquid in it.  And sincs its not attached, it got lost after it popped out .  Horrible!  Save your money.

Kitchen	Thermos Funtainer 12 Ounce Bottle	fairly good
Jewelry	BodyJ4You 18PCS Gauge Tunnel Kit 14G-00G Stainless Steel Ear Plugs Stretching Set Single Flared Expanders	If you're wondering from the slightly ambiguous wording in the item description (you know how some sellers would consider the tunnel one piece and the o-ring as another = 2 pcs) -- you DO get two tunnels and two rings of each gauge.<br /><br />The 14 gauges aren't &#34;tunnels&#34; in that they're so small there is no &#34;tube&#34; through them- they are solid, but they do match the style of the rest of the tunnels with the flared fronts and ridged back for holding your o-ring..  getting that TINY o-ring on is tough because it's so small so you might need help (I did).  Also, the 14gs were slightly larger than a standard 14g ring or taper.. not enough that I felt the need to grab my 12g taper, but enough that I did notice there was a difference and it needed a little extra push to get them through.  However, I will say- sleeping with tunnels in your double helixes?  WAY more comfortable than sleeping with rings in them.<br /><br />To be noted- the O-Rings have to be tight- otherwise, they slip off easily and if the o-ring doesn't stay on, your tunnel will fall out in your sleep, and all that stretching progress can be lost- especially if you're working with cartilage, so tight o-rings are a GOOD thing.<br /><br />I have piercings of a variety of sizes in my ears, and have been wanting to gauge my lobes from their 6g & 4gs to 00gs for ever, and just never got around to it..  This kit is perfect for me because I like to stairstep my stretching with a variety of sizes all at once- so I've always got at least one side of my head that I can sleep on.<br /><br />This kit is lovely.  I would never believe that it was a $3 set (when I bought it).  The metal is smooth and polished.  The tunnels are sturdy.  The rings fit tightly.  They're all labeled in individual resealable packages..  Aside from the 14 gauges being slightly large, I can't find any flaws with any of them.<br />This set is definitely worth the gamble.<br /><br />Came back to edit a week later--<br />I justwanted to add- a week in- and no problems, no skin reactions, no signs of rust (some cheap sets do that), the rings have stayed tight, and I still love them on all counts.<br /><br />Came back a MONTH later--<br />Once again, I came in to add- it's been a month with them in- and NO problems, no signs of rust, no deterioration of the o-rings- and I still love them.<br /><br />Came back TWO YEARS later--<br />I am still using these.  I have the two 10g in my helixes- they have been in there from day one- taken out only for cleaning, they have gone through showers/baths and hair products being sprayed around them every day for that entire time.  No sign of rust, no irritations, no issues whatsoever.  Not a single tunnel in the set has given me any trouble.  As time went by a few of the smallest o-rings got a little hard- but that did not lessen their ability to do their jobs- and I'm still using the original o-rings on them.<br /><br />If I could give them a higher rating I would.  I just can't tell you enough- even at the new price- THIS SET IS WORTH THE MONEY.<br />Awesome set for an even awesome-r price.
Jewelry	Nanny I Love Heart My Silver Toggle Necklace Crystal Black Rectangle Jewelry	A+
Kitchen	Ilsa Gas Ring Reducer, 5-Inch, Cast Iron	I now can cook a lot of dishes that require slow and long cooking time without burning them up because of this little helper here. It diffuses the heat evenly and prevent the pot or pan from burning or having food stick to the bottom for longer cooking time dishes.
Kitchen	Da Vinci Natural Bamboo Large Wood Cutting Board - 12 x 16 Inch, 1 Board	Bamboo cutting board  Have only had it a few months.  Used regularly but seems to be holding up ok.  I did use some mineral oil to protect it as it doesn't have any kind of oiled finish on it.
Kitchen	Style Setter 210898-GR Mason Beverage Dispenser	Good price, perfect size, easy to clean.
Kitchen	Cake Boss Nylon Tools and Gadgets Cake Server, Red	Best serving tool. No scratches and very solid. Bought for myself and for a friend. We both love it.

Kitchen	New Star 46144 Polycarbonate Plastic Tapered Style Restaurant Water Pitcher, 60-Ounce, Clear	great
Kitchen	StarPack Premium Silicone Kitchen Tongs 9-Inch, Non-Stick Friendly, Bonus 101 Cooking Tips	Exactly as advertised.  These tongs have a good weight to them and I love the silicone lining to prevent burns.  Highly recommended.
Jewelry	Hip Mall Vintage Choker Punk Emo O-ring Leather Collar Necklace	Fit perfectly but came in creased in half on one end so the choker is permanently bend out of shape and looks ugly and damaged in that one spot.
Jewelry	Chisel Stainless Steel Polished CZ Ring	Nice ring<br />Solid built
Jewelry	"SHINYSO Stainless Steel Silver Women's & Men's Fashion ""Lingering Love Cross""Couple Pendant Necklace Set"	Love them.
Jewelry	1.07ct. Natural Amethyst 925 Sterling Silver Filigree Triquetra Celtic Knot Eternity Ring	Arrived on time and is just as pictured. I have yet to take it off.
Jewelry	Betsey Johnson Women's Gifting Tiara Pin Pendant Necklace Siam Pendant Necklace	The pin is pretty, but the center red stone is severely off center.  It is as if it were glued on and slid 1/2 way off.  I don't know how that could have gone unnoticed.  I'm afraid if I pull the stone off to re-set, it will remove the stone's backing.
Kitchen	Cuisinart ICE-70 Electronic Ice Cream Maker, Brushed Chrome	This ice cream maker is super easy to operate and I am so very pleased with how fast and good it freezes ice cream. I love that there is no mess with ice and salt!  I feel, your recipe will determine how hard or soft your ice cream ends up.  I used a recipe that I got years ago from milnot milk and it froze very nicely.  I was able to dip it and it hold shape by the time it was frozen!  You can see the ice cream churning and getting thick.  I like that I can add choc chips, nuts, coconut, or such towards the end through the opening in the lid... and the added bonus for me is being able to sneak a spoonful while it is freezing.  I read reviews about it being loud... I do agree-- it is loud, but it's worth it!  I like that it makes a small batch when it's just for me and my husband, but I do wish I could buy it in a bigger size too to use for family gatherings. You can buy extra bowls to keep in the freezer and make one batch after the other, but that doesn't serve everyone fresh ice cream at the same time.  I have to mention that I did buy some of the 6 oz tovolo ice cream containers to freeze leftovers in. While 6 oz may seem small, it is a nice portion to satisfy a sweet tooth without a ton of calories! When you are ready to eat one of them, the silicone lid stays soft and comes off easy.  If you let the ice cream set at room temp for just a few minutes (maybe 4-5 min) your spoon will dip in more easily.  I have even microwaved it for 10 seconds and that works great too.  I highly recommend this Ice Cream Maker... we use ours often!
Kitchen	Tovolo Ice Molds.	Really happy with these ice molds. They work exactly as advertised, and I really enjoy having a chilled glass of bourbon without the drink being totally watered down by regular ice cubes.

Kitchen	Gusteaux Quadghetti Spiralizer - High Quality Handheld Vegetable Spiral Slicer Bundle with 4 Removable Stainless Steel Blades - Best Zucchini Noodle (Zoodle), Julienne & Veggie Pasta Maker	Seems very nice, easy to use. Not as big as expected, though.  Storage pouch smells like fresh tar so that will be discarded.

Kitchen	Keurig K550 Coffee Maker Single Serve 2.0 Brewing System with Top Needle Cleaning Maintenance Accessory and My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter, Platinum	I love the Keurig system and have been using it for so long now at work, at my leasing office, at other people's events. I finally got my own and it is a gem to have- quick, easy, convenient, reliable, and i love that you can brew any type of coffee you want (preferably starbucks). It is just so handy! And it helps me stay awake, stay focused, and get my day or night going depending on what type of work I have to do. I would 100% recommend anyone to buy this machine, and keep the love for coffee and tea alive! Also,Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review!
Kitchen	T-Fal/Wearever 9664000A Jelly Strainer	I read all the reviews.  There is nothing wrong with this item.  It is what it is and saying that its just a described it works great, I'm using it for more than just making Jelly I'm not a avid cook and its just great for me,  don't know what other people were expecting.  I'm very pleased.  Came with other items but still came early.
Kitchen	Cuisinairre Bubble 21-Inch Clear Plastic Bubble for Cotton Candy Floss Machine	If fits well with the machine, but, it makes such a horrible noise. I have to put paper around the base so it would make a quiter noise. Also, for a brand new item, its all scratch and looks foggy on the top.  I had to ship it to my best friend's house in Florida in order to get it here to Puerto Rico.  Honestly, noth worth a $100.00 dollars.
Kitchen	Brentwood KT1785 Stainless Steel Electric Tea Kettle, 1.5-Liter, Red	Perfect. Fast. Love the color. Still working after 2 years (used two times per days)
Jewelry	14k Yellow Gold and White Gold Heart Children Screwback Baby Girls Stud Earrings	escelent

Jewelry	Belly Button Ring Navel 316L Surgical Steel, Logo, Dangle, Batman Body Jewelry	Made my belly button super infected and it started rejecting, I had to take it out and now I have a gross scar. Don't put colored metal in your belly before a year. The shape of the ring was so weird too.
Jewelry	The SAK Metal Crochet Drop Earrings	These are so beautiful and I love to wear them. The silver is etched clearly and the contrasting black makes the earrings the only jewelry you need to wear.
Jewelry	Sterling Silver Celtic Cross Pendant Necklace	This is a good piece of necklace. Wont' lose it. Thanks!
Kitchen	Paderno World Cuisine Spiral Vegetable Slicer / Countertop-Mounted Plastic Spiralizer Basic incl. 3 Different Blades Made of Stainless Steel	I think this was a great product with some flaws, I tried a zucchini, and in the end it worked great however it was hard to get it to stay on the prongs, and get it going to slice.  The blades are sharp and it is better then the hand held version.  I thought it was difficult to stabilize the fruit while pushing and turning the handle to cut.  I wouldn't say it is a loss though and will use this again and again.  I am sure once I get the hang of it it will be much easier. So dependng on what you want to use it for, I do recommend this product!
Kitchen	Blue Donuts Clear Bread/Food bags - 100 bags including twist ties	I first did a very negative review of this product thinking they were way too small for my bread machine bread. However, I just realized that I had not opened the bag completely. They are perfect! I am so happy to have found a bag big enough for bread machine bread. Sorry if my first post made you had orate to order.
Jewelry	Pandora Bead Inner Radiance Golden and Clear CZ 791370CCZ	Very share
Jewelry	Pink AB Rhinestone Small Round Gold Tone Stud Post Earrings	These are even more beautiful in person.They shine and sparkle and look so beautifully vintage. They come with bullet clutch earring backs. They have stayed in with no problems. This photo doesn't do them justice. If you are looking for something unique and special, these are it!<br /><br />**I received these for a discount in exchange for my unbiased review**
Jewelry	Sannysis Infinity Love Heart Key Lock Friendship Antique Leather Charm Bracelet	5 stars, looks just like the  picture and fast delivery thank you
Kitchen	Smilism Diaper Bag	Very well made and does an excellent job and is easy on my hands.  I have arthritis and do not have a lot of strength in my hands any more.  I plan on hand washing to maintain the beautiful finish although it indicates dishwasher safe.  I shopped for quite awhile and chose this one pacifically because the handles do not  totally chose together which helps because closing my hand is difficult anymore.  I also like the larger bowl sometimes lemons can be quite large.
Kitchen	OXO SteeL Garlic Press, Stainless	It is pretty to look at and sturdy.  However, the garlic chamber is a little small (holds only one clove at a time) and the handles have seams which allow them to fill with water when you wash it.  I love OXO, so it won't stop me from trying and buying other products, but if I had known these two things about this garlic press, I wouldn't have ordered it.
Kitchen	EatSmart Precision Pro Digital Kitchen Scale, White	love it!
Jewelry	SilberDream Charm apple, 925 Sterling Silver Charms Pendant with Lobster Clasp for Charms Bracelet, Necklace or Charms Carrier FC3109	Kind of cheap looking and looks more like a cherry.
Kitchen	The Mexican Kitchen by Rick Bayless Reversible Grill, Large, Black	When an item is so heavy you have to ask your husband to help you take it out of the box, you know already that this is not something you are going to enjoy using in your kitchen!<br />OK, maybe I should have read the fine print more carefully, but would anyone expect a grill that the cook is expected to position over stove burners and clean up manually afterwards to weigh 19 pounds? That may have been my fault, but I did read enough to reassure myself from the Amazon page that the grill was dishwasher safe; the manual, however, says to wash by hand with mild detergent, like most cast-iron.<br />I had hoped to use this grill in my oven as an adjunct to the normal broiler pan, but it is JUST too wide to do so. I started to slide it into the oven, but it was scraping the sides of the oven,so I desisted.  Its surface is rough enough that I fear it is also likely to scratch my glass cooktop, and the rough surface, large size, and weight make me also think it may scratch my sink when I clean it.<br />If I were big and strong, I think this might be a nice accessory for my outdoor grill, but it is not something I am willing to use in my kitchen. Sorry, Rick, no me gusta.

Jewelry	Tzou Vintage Tibetan Silver Ethnic Gothic Oval Turquoise Inlay Wide Bangle Women	I love this little bracelet, it did turn my arm green though after the first wearing. :( So I can only give it about three stars. It is super cute, but needs to be coated.
Jewelry	"Miguel Ases Prehnite and Mother of Pearl Oval Drop Earrings, 1.35"""	I am disappointed in these earrings.  They are much smaller than expected and they look sort of glued together.  The part that is supposed to be mother of pearl looks rather like plastic up close.  Since I got them for only $34.00 I kept them.  They are not bad, just not nearly as nice as I expected for their original price of about $100.00.
Jewelry	CrazyPiercing 30 PCS (a lot) 316 surgical Steel Metal Tongue rings barbells body piercing	All pieces are great .! I like to switch my tongue rings out cause after a while they tend to get kinda nasty. You really can't beat the price on this .! And I love the designs. There is at least one thing for everyone .!
Kitchen	SunrisePro Knife Sharpener, USA patented, Original	wasn't sure if i would like it so i brought it to a beach rental as the knives are always dull and of medium to low quality.  It did a nice job sharpening up a set of Faberware knives with a little time.  Good purchase, works well!

Jewelry	EVER FAITH Bridal Silver-Tone Teardrop Leaf Clear Austrian Crystal Necklace Earrings Set	Absolutely beautiful necklace and earrings. Thank you so much. Exactly what I wanted
Jewelry	"Sterling Silver Freshwater Cultured Pearl with Sapphire Halo Pendant Necklace, 18"""	This is a very beautiful necklace. The pendant is smaller than pictured, but is still large enough to be seen and look classy without being &#34;gaudy&#34;  The sterling silver box chain is nice, but I prefer a slightly longer chain, so I replaced it with one I already had. The pearl, as well as the other stones are securely fastened in place, with no sign of adhesive or fasteners.  The stones are very tight as well.  I think this is a lovely piece of jewelry, and I would not think twice about purchasing another piece of jewelry from this company.

Kitchen	Corelle Country Cottage Glass Cutting Board	Perfect for under my toaster oven.  Just what I was looking for.
Kitchen	Reusable Straws for Smoothies and Shakes. Heat Resistant for Coffee and Tea. Soft, Safe Silicone. Adults and Kids.	My wife and I were looking for reusable straws after we acquired iced coffee addictions and were burning through regular straws. I was unsure how I'd like using a silicone straw but after doing a simple wash as instructed they worked great and didn't have any sort of plasticky taste.The fact that they separate at the curve is also brilliant and makes them super easy to clean.<br /><br />Can't wait to buy more as gifts for family and friends!

Kitchen	BLACK+DECKER 400-Watt Fruit and Vegetable Juice Extractor, Black, JE2200B	I just love my juicer. This was the first juicer that I purchased. It works well. Cleaning could be a little easier but other than that it works great. Juices  everything I love. You must cut your fruit in smaller pieces with this juicer.
Kitchen	Hamilton Beach 12-Cup Stack and Snap Food Processor (70725A)	Great product love it, would buy another
Kitchen	Disposable Cups for Use in Keurig Brewers - Simple Cups - 50 Cups, Lids, and Filters - Use Your Own Coffee in K-cups	These come in real handy for visitors make up some and keep on hand.Of course I use mine up when I'm lazy and don't want to make up a cup then wash it and put it away just use and toss.
Kitchen	Infuser Water Bottle (Orange)	I've used this bottle several times already and I really like. Great bottle for the price. I noticed that some customers stated that their bottle leaks, I haven't had that problem. I done all the leak test i could think of but mine doesn't leak. If you have a problem with leaks when you first get it make sure the lid is on properly. I will be ordering another bottle soon.

Kitchen	FoodWorks Silicone Ice Pop Maker Molds/Popsicle Molds, Set of 6	So far so good. Just have to be careful as there is a learning curve to opening and shutting them if the contents is even a little melted. I think maybe 8 and up could handle it in a lunchbox.
Kitchen	Reusable K-cups for Keurig 2.0 Brewers -Pack of 2	The thickness of the top doesnt allow the Keurig to close nicely, but it functions well.  What I like the best is that I no longer have to monkey with the stupid sensor that gave me grief when I used my other k-cups.  I just finished my first cup of joe from the k-cup and aside from adjusting my brew strength over the next couple of cups, it is ideal.<br /><br />FOR THOSE WONDERING, APPARENTLY THE MANUFACTURER DID SOMETHING WITH THE COLOR DIE IN THE TOP OF THE K-CUP THAT TELLS THE SENSOR THIS IS AN OFFICIAL K-CUP FOR A 2.0 MACHINE.  THIS IS PERFECT!

Kitchen	Zeroll Original Ice Cream Scoop	Heavy-duty ice cream scoop made in the USA, hip hip hurray. It is weighty and sturdy. FYI, the &#34;color&#34; indicates the size of the scoop. It has nothing to do with coordinating with your kitchen. Blue is 3 ounces times two scoops for you and me, and everybody is happy as a clam. NOTE: as instructions clearly state. Do NOT wash in dishwasher. I have other similar aluminum ice cream scoopers and have never had an issue with corrosion.

Jewelry	April Cubic Zirconia Birthstone, Sterling Tear Ash Holder Necklace	I'm so happy with this purchase.  It is more beautiful in person.  Good quality.  I did buy a different chain.  I needed it to be a bit longer & more sturdy.  I had difficulty getting the cremains in using the funnel, so I used to spoon provided & carefully &#34;poured&#34; them in.  This necklace holds a lot so be patient.  Shipping was fast.

Kitchen	Egg Poacher Cups (4 Pack)	As someone who loves to cook in the kitchen and enjoys a nice poached egg, I was eager to try the Silicone Egg Poacher 4 Pack by Kitchen Essentials.  I have never tried anything like this before, so I was excited to see how it worked out.I like that all of the egg stays in the silicone cup and I don't lose any in the pot like I normally do. Nothing stuck and they were easily cleaned with soap and water. I put wooden skewers through the holes to keep it stable on the rim of the simmering water and melted some chocolate too.  I am going to try other ways to use these egg poachers.  I think they are really nice and work good.  I received this product in exchange for a review. All my opinions are my own, based on my personal experience with the product.

Kitchen	The Original EDGY Wine Foil Cutter Accessory with Stunning Gift Box, Easy Wine Bottle Opening for Wine Lovers, Red	I used to gaze at the fancier bottles of wine in my collection yearning to drink them, but completely befuddled as to how to find the bottle's cork.  I knew the cork was hiding somewhere underneath the shiny metal foil firmly affixed to the bottle neck, shimmering like an elusive mirage.  However, attempts to remove this stubborn oenophilic chastity belt with a knife or a scissors proved futile, and on one occasion practically fatal.  While awaiting paramedics to arrive after severing a major artery and collapsing face down in a puddle of my own blood, I vowed to never again risk my own life attempting to remove another dastardly wine foil.<br /><br />And so I was sadly relegated to drinking screw-top bottles of wine, doomed to live a pathetic, solitary life.  I soon learned that nobody wants to be with a man who only drinks screw top or boxed wines; that's no a man, that's a child.  Feeling hopeless and lonely, I decided to cash in my life savings and move to Minsk where I could spend the rest of my days drowning my sorrows in bottles of vodka with easily removable caps.<br /><br />In a shocking twist of fate, on the morning of the day I was set to leave on a one-way flight to Minsk with no possibility of return, I happened upon an advertisement for a life-saving product called Edgy.  Edgy provides a safe, reliable way to remove wine foils with no messes and no accidents.  Now, the fancy bottles of wine that used to mock and taunt me are crushed like ladybugs.  I guzzle Domaine Leflaive Montrachets, Screaming Eagle Cabernets, and Henri Jayer Richebourg Cotes de Nuits like bottles of water, all thanks to Edgy.  Yes, I am now drunk literally all of the time, but I'm also happily married (I think) to a woman (I think) who is stunningly beautiful (I think).  And it's all because of Edgy.<br /><br />So thank you, Edgy, for saving my life.

Jewelry	Sterling Silver Rolo-Chain Necklace	I chose to overlook the fact that this is NOT A ROLLO CHAIN, as stated in the description and as shown in the photo.  That was my first mistake.  Anyway, after initial inspection, I put the necklace, unworn, back into the box, where it sat for almost two months (long story).  When I removed it from the box to wear it today, it had TARNISHED IN THE BOX, UNWORN!!!<br /><br />This vendor is not sending the product it promised and the product that is being sent is of grossly inferior quality.  Do yourself a favor and do not waste your time or money.
Jewelry	"Cavalier Jewelers 8MM Men's Black Titanium Masonic Ring Engraved ""VIRTUS JUNXIT MORS NON SEPARABIT"""	Excellent quality and shipping. Very pleased with the product.  Many of may fellow Masons would enjoy the ring.

Kitchen	Emeril Pre-Seasoned Cast Iron Vertical Poultry Roaster	1st use produced a very nice, well browned and juicy bird. Added potato and onion to the tray and they cooked up very nicely. I've used it both on the grill and in the oven...works equally well. Order of magnitude better than fussing with beer cans or pedestals. Recommend it......it's worth the investment.
Kitchen	Zojirushi NP-HCC10XH Induction Heating System Rice Cooker and Warmer	Liked the rice cooker, but the cords can get in the way and the paddle holder could also be better designed.  I sure wished it was retractable cord.  Small convience can go a long way in higher rating.
Kitchen	"Mind Reader ""Anchor"" Coffee Pack Drawer for Keurig Vue Packs, Keurig K-Cups, Nespresso Capsules, CBTL/Verismo Pods or Tassimo T-Discs"	I like the drawers because it keeps the coffee cups organized and conserves space. Overall looks nice, only complaint is the drawers. They are a little loose but overall still a good purchase.

Kitchen	Omega J8004 Nutrition Center Commercial Masticating Juicer, White	This juicer is actually really terrible! I read a lot of reviews and ended up getting this one. Had it a couple years and find it just is not useful. The small feed tube requires you to spend a lot of time prepping before you can actually juice. And this juicer does NOT does well with squishy fruit. Forget about juicing pineapple... it does not work. Anything squishy does not get pushed through the matiscator and you have to empty out the entire assembly to continue juicing. I would NOT recommend this to anyone who actually wants to juice regularly. You will spend way to much time for the whole process.

Thank you to the holy land souvenir. I am looking to buy another one but I will see it's no longer available right now. Do you know if this item will be selling again?
Kitchen	SunrisePro Knife Sharpener, USA patented, Original	This product is fantastic.  I was wary of the hype in the description but it is very simple to use and I sharpened all of my knives in a  few minutes - and they are VERY sharp - like new.  Its hard to tell from the picture that this sharpener is less than 3 inches wide and tall, so it fits easily in my knife drawer.
Jewelry	Top Quality 925 Sterling Silver Rhodium Plated Bar Necklace	The chain and bar are delicate and cute! The bar itself is approximately 2 inches wide. The only issue I've seen on myself so far is that sometimes the bar portion doesn't lie horizontally, but scoots up to be diagonal. It's cute and I would order another one!
Kitchen	EZ Off Jar Opener For All Jar Sizes, White	Super handy

Jewelry	Unistyle 4 Pairs Set Hoop Earrings Black Blue Gold Silver	When I first got these, I noticed the awesome gift box they came in. Then, inside were 4 individually wrapped packages of ear rings. The colors are vibrant and beautiful. I love that they are hinged and they have a locking clasp so they don't accidently fall out of your ears. I have been wearing these for 2 days now and they are lightweight and beautiful. They go with anything I could wear them with and they are sturdy enough for me to wear them 24/7 and not have to worry about taking them out at night.<br />*I received this product at a discount for my honest, unbiased review*

The blades are stainless steel and very sharp…..built very well. Worth the money. Being 71 and my hands are stiff from arthritis this really helps me a lot.
Kitchen	Trudeau Fuel Glacier Food Container, Orange	These containers are absolute garbage. We bought two, after 2 months the lid for the first one had a crack running down the centre, after 3 months the second one has multiple cracks. We're left with two bottoms, and no workable lids, unless you want Styrofoam in your food.

Kitchen	PUR 18 Cup Dispenser with One Pitcher Filter	Very happy with this purchase. The water quality where we live isn't the best, it tastes horrible! After reading all the reviews between Pur and Brita, we decided on the Pur due to its high rankings, ability to clean and great tasting water. And we couldn't be happier with our choice. This is a great choice! It's slim profile takes up minimal room in the fridge while holding substantial water. The quality of the water is amazing, it tastes great! Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase again.

Kitchen	PUR 5 Cup Water Filter Pitcher CR-4000	Works great! Fits well in the fridge. The only reason it lost a star is that the bottom is not perfectly flat, which makes it rock some, which could be a disaster if bumped.
Kitchen	Brimma Leak Proof Fruit Infuser Water Bottle, Large 32 Oz.	I was so excited to get this infuser bottle I couldn't wait. I love that the bottle has a lid to it that opens and closes. Its convenient to carry and has a rubber grip to the sides so it doesn't slip when it gets wet. Its durable to spills of any kind and best part is it holds 32 oz of water!!! The infuser is great and stores a large amount of any fruit to your liking. I will tell many of my friends and family to purchase this item!<br />*disclaimer item was purchased at a low cost amount in return for a honest nonbiased review

Kitchen	Viable Creations Handcrafted Bamboo Wooden Spoons with Cotton Muslin Bag - Set of 5	If you use wooden spoons and spatulas in your kitchen, and you should be.  Viable Creations culinary set is the best I have owned. This is a very nice set, they are heavy duty, very well-made, and they feel good in your hands- both ergonomic and smooth.<br />I’ve been using them for all of my cooking needs and I’m completely happy about my purchase. You will not be disappointed with the quality of this set. I’m also impressed with Viable Creations customer service, very professional and helpful with questions I had about maintaining the spoons. Hand wash with mild soap and apply olive oil or a food safe oil occasionally to keep them looking new.<br /><br />I highly recommend this company and this bamboo set. 5 out of 5 stars.

Kitchen	Reynolds Non-stick Foil 35 sq ft Roll (2 Pack)	I don't like using foil too much, it seems wasteful, but I use this when I'm in a hurry and don't want a lot of clean up.  It really cuts down on scrubbing/soaking time when I roast vegetables.  Roasted squashes, potatoes, or other root veggies, just slide off. Even aspargus with parmesan, the browned cheese slides off for a pretty serving and no scrubbing afterwards.
Jewelry	Grade 23 Solid Titanium Barbell with Balls (Sold Individually)	I'm mildly allergic to surgical steel, so this has been in my conche for a solid 4 months.  Every now and then a ball will fall off when I'm cleaning my ear, but that's to be expected with any jewelry.

Kitchen	De'Longhi America EN750MB Nespresso Lattissima Pro Machine	You will have to adjust the settings to make larger amounts of liquid but I just hit the button twice, for Example if I want a Macchiato I let it go thru it's cycle and then I hit the button on the coffee side, the largest one (i forgot the name of it) its does not change the flavor at all!! Great machine! Oh and the milk is not cold going thru. but if you like it hotter just do the milk cleaning first and it will make are the parts the milk goes thru, hot.
Kitchen	BUNN MCU Single Cup Multi-Use Home Coffee Brewer	Great Coffee maker. Better than competitiors

Kitchen	16 Piece Indoor/Outdoor Melamine Dinnerware Set RED	I love this set and I'm considering ordering another.  I ordered these to compliment my ceramic plates from Pier 1. They are so sturdy, that they seem like ceramic.  The small bowls were much smaller than expected, though, maybe only hold 2 tablespoons.

Jewelry	Sterling Silver Five Plumeria Flower Necklace with Simulated Blue Opal	While I usually like my necklaces a tad bigger than this, it turns out I was won over by this necklace just the way it was. It is really so beautiful and eye-catching! It doesn't seem to matter that it is synthetic. It is equally as lovely as the earrings I got to match that were real.

Jewelry	Dxhycc 925 Sterling Silver Elegant Clip-on Button Style Floral Design Bracelet Bangle Jewellery	I loved my first bracelet so much that I ordered 3 more! I do have large wrists for a female so they are snug when closed but no doubt these will fit a &quot;average&quot; wrist just fine. I just wear mine open and layered them up and put a little spin on the traditional bangle style. I do have to say that the flower can get caught on things from time to time BUT these beauties have held up!
Kitchen	"Vivree Kitchen Tongs Set - Salad & Grill Stainless Steel Serving Tongs with Silicone Tips - 7"", 9""&12"" - Tongs"	These are wonderful tongs! I just used them for canning peach jam, and they were perfect in lifting lids and jars out of boiling water.
Kitchen	Keurig Stainless Steel Travel Mug	This travel mug serves its purpose in preventing leaks and spills, but it is not my favorite. It works great to keep your coffee hot for about an hour, and I can honestly say that it had never leaked. The unique button-release design is a simple yet effective approach to quickly taking a swig of coffee without having to fuss with cumbersome latches. However, there are two problems with this mug that I have encountered over a few months of use. 1. The hole that the coffee comes out of is much too small and makes it very difficult to sip hot coffee without burning yourself. This is a stark contrast to my yetti mug, which I use for both hot and cold beverages. 2. The lip of the plastic lid that you place into your mouth has a rough, grainy sort of texture. I prefer a slick, smooth plastic that resembles something closer to the feel of glass. Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase, and I received my mug in a timely fashion. But, this is not my go-to mug for coffee.
Kitchen	Murano Glass Collection Swirl Design Wine Pourer/Stopper	Beautiful wine stopper!!  Unique, because it is a functional 2-in-1 unit with the pourer and wine stopper.  Love it!  Would be a great gift or perfect Christmas stocking stuffer for your wine loving friends/family!!
Jewelry	Inox Flattened Oval Stainless Steel Hoop Earrings	Great earrings. Nice weight. Fast delivery
Kitchen	OXO Good Grips Turkey Baster	I actually bought this to siphon grease out of the frying pan, when I'm cooking high fat meats, like hamburger and bacon.  It works like a charm and it cleans beautifully.  I use it often.  I've thrown it into the dishwasher - no fuss no muss.  Such a great kitchen tool!
Jewelry	5MM Stainless Surgical Steel Twist Cable Magnet Bangle Cuff Bracelet	Fits wrist perfectly.  Great material.  Nice!
Jewelry	Sterling Silver Genuine Blue Topaz and Created Blue Sapphire Cluster Stud Earrings	These earrings are beautiful - the colors are just as vibrant as the picture, they are well set and they look great in the box. So I was bummed when they didn't show off as nice on my ears. Everybody's ears are different, so I'm trying not to generalize, but on my ears, 2/3 of the earrings were off of my lobes and because of the weight, they sort of pull forward where the pin goes through and back at the bottom, so the earring hangs slanted backward. So people see more of the top of the setting, than the actual stones and it's hard to appreciate how pretty they are! I've never had this particular issue with earrings before, so I think they may be just slightly oddly weighted to look their best once they are in your ears. Still, the blues  are great and set off blue eyes really well and I'm sure for other people's ears they may look just as great in your ears as they do in the box.
Jewelry	Bling Jewelry 316L Steel Simulated Opalite Belly Ring	Thought it was opal it's more like foggy clear. But it's cute
Kitchen	XBH Silicone Jello Chocolate Pudding Baking Mould Cake Decoration DIY Car/Bike Style	Using this for CP soap.  Nice 4.5 oz bar with tons of details.  Comes out of mold perfectly.  Mold is very pliable so be sure to have it on a sturdy board/tray if you plan on moving it after you pour them.

Kitchen	Rubbermaid Easy Find Lids Glass Food Storage Container, 8-piece Set (2856008)	It is kind of hard to get the lids off of some of them and on the other hand, one of the lids didn't fit tightly enough and food spilled.
Kitchen	Keurig Brewing System	I have had my K250 for about a month.  Before that I had the K40.  Both systems are very easy to use and make a great cup of coffee.  Coffee from a regular coffee maker doesn't seem to taste as good anymore. I would never go back to a regular coffee maker! The particular machine is very easy to use and the color options are great.  I personally have the turquoise and I love the colors vibrancy! I also love that this machine has an option to make your coffee stronger. I prefer to have the water reservoir to the side rather than the back of the machine. Having the reservoir to the side allows it to be removed easily for filling without having to move the machine each time or use a cup to fill it. I also wish it had an option to make the coffee hotter.  The temperature is good but adding cream definitely makes it a little cooler than I prefer.  Keurigs customer service is also impeccable.  I had pods that only worked with my old machine.  I called them and they replaced them for free and no questions asked!!! Overall this is an excellent machine for the cost.  I would buy it again and recommend it anyone!!! Keep up the good work Keurig!!!
Kitchen	BUNN HG Phase Brew 8-Cup Home Coffee Brewer	This coffee maker has doubled in price in one year so when you read the reviews you should consider that.  It makes coffee.  Period.  The lid leaks after putting in the dishwasher and I can't find a replacement carafe now.  It was fine for what I paid, but seriously. It just makes coffee like any other coffee maker.  I still have to heat it for 30 seconds for it to be hot enough for me just like I would any other normal coffee maker.
Jewelry	Fossil Stainless Steel Teardrop Hoop Earrings	My wife bought these because she has sensitive ear and even the &#34;sensitive&#34; ear rings cause her ear lobes to swell.  These work great and no swelling.  We will be purchasing more stainless steel ear rings in the future
Jewelry	Gold-Tone Mint-Colored Teardrop Earrings	Lovely,very delicate color!
Jewelry	TOOPOOT® Fashion Women Vintage Design Stack Above Knuckle Nail Ring Set of Six Rings	This is a nice assortment. I have used it to figure out if I want to step up to pricier rings in sterling or gold. In the meantime, be sure to give these a good coating of clear nail lacquer because the metal will oxidize and turn your skin green...I am not complaining, understand, it goes with the territory.
Kitchen	KitchenAid KSM155GB 5 Qt. Artisan Design Series Stand Mixer	Christmas gift to myself last year.  Such a beautiful and highly functional kitchen tool. I have the Candy Apple Red and it's a stunner. Great addition to my kitchen arsenal.  I agree with the other reviewers on the cheap look and feel to the utensils.  Disappointing. I bought the mixing utensil with the rubber scraper blades on the edges from Amazon and highly recommend it.  Overall, this mixer blends and mixes most ingredients like a dream. I have not used the mixer heavily and when I do use it I tend to make cookie dough.  I have made pizza dough a couple of times and it's so amazing.<br /><br />The last two times I made cookie dough the motor audibly struggled after I added 2-1/4 cups of flour. I feel like this should not be happening.  Understandable maybe if I was making a double batch.  I'm hoping this isn't the start of a bigger problem. This along with the low quality of the utensils is why this item is rated 4 stars.<br /><br />I also bought the metal mixing bowl and highly recommend the pour shield.

Kitchen	Ideal Home Range 16 Count Boston International 3-Ply Paper Guest Towel Napkins, Linen Tea Rose	Lovely pattern, nice thickness. These guest towels/napkins look beautiful when displayed. Set them out for guests and although I received a few compliments on them,  not a one was used. Very happy with this purchase.
Kitchen	Breville BJS600XL Fountain Crush Masticating Slow Juicer	Great juicer! I was skeptical of buying a juicer because i'd figured we wouldn't use it due to the pain of cleaning it.  I was wrong, we use it almost every day, it's easy to clean compared to most centrifuge juicers especially if you clean right after juicing, you can do a quick rinse of the parts and leave to dry.  The only caveat is leafy greens, they really make a mess inside the juicer mesh... Love this juicer!!!

Kitchen	Breville BOV650XL the Compact Smart Oven Stainless Steel	Look elsewhere. Invested $200 in this oven and it stopped working in less than two years. I used it for heating up food less than 20 mins at a time on average three times a week. Contacted customer support and they offered to repair it for $99.00. I'll take my chances with a $50 oven at Target for now on.

It is adorable.  She will love it.
Jewelry	Sterling Silver Diamond Heart Ring (1/4 cttw, I-J Color, I3 Clarity)	Beautiful ring! I love how it sparkles, and that, while it's a &#34;heart&#34; ring, it doesn't scream HEART in a juvenile, flashy, or over-the-top way. It's very elegant and classy, and the size 8 fits exactly as expected. I'm so excited about this gorgeous ring!

Jewelry	"Gold IP Non-Piercing Septum Hanger 3/8"" (Sold Individually) & FREE ITEMS"	Fits right in ur nose, I haven't worn it out yet but it has a tight grasp, especially if you push it up further, although it is smaller than I thought it would be.
Jewelry	"Mens Stainless Steel Pill Cross Necklace Pendant - Black & Silver, 21"" Inches Chain"	This little item on my key chain is hardly noticeable.  It's very small but perfect for holding a half dozen nitro pills.  Just so you know, it's too small for a full size aspirin.  I'm glad I got it.
Kitchen	The Keurig Rivo Cappuccino and Latte System	Over all I've very pleased with the machine after operating it.  I've owned several espresso machines over the years that were messy end results were so so.  The only down size I've seen so far is that the machine is not very consistent from shot to shot as far as volume. The guide says output should be 1.4 oz for a short and I've seen it shoot ,and I've seen it go from 1 oz to 1.4 oz . The issue seems to stem from the Rivo cups  not getting punctures at the bottom all the way. The frothing part of the machine works perfectly.
Kitchen	Glass Dharma Beautiful Bends Glass Straw	I loved this straw while it lasted. I used it for my hot tea in the monring. Unfortunately I dropped it on my kitchen floor and it shattered. I will definitely be ordering a replacement. Well worth the investment.

Kitchen	Debbie Meyer 32 Piece UltraLite GreenBoxes - Green	I love these storage boxes.  I get my salads ready for work at the beginning of the week and don't have to worry that the romaine will be brown at the end of the week.  They seal well, so no accidents or spills. I have also stored open cucumbers without worry of early spoilage.  Herbs keep well.  Berries also.  Produce is expensive to throw out after just a few days. These little &#34;miracle&#34; green boxes help me save time and money.

I was so excited for it to arrive and when it did I didn't think I could get the box open fast enough.  And it was even more wonderful than I expected.  It's just gorgeous.  Dainty.  Very shiny and beautiful patina.  The photos don't nearly do it justice.

Kitchen	Demeyere 4-Cup Egg Cooker/Poacher	I love this thing!  Still need to spray in some PAM before you drop the eggs in the cups, but once you do, and the eggs are done, you just flip the cups over and out the eggs come.  Short prep time, fast cooking and easy cleanup.

Kitchen	Mcusta Zanmai Classic 3.5-inch Paring Knife	We own several Shun knives, to be honest, this blade is better. It has better edge retention and is very hard. The handle is excellent, this is my GO-TO knife. I use it for everything. Don't be scared, just get it. It is one purchase you will NEVER regret!

Jewelry	Sterling Silver Necklace Music Note Symbol: Heart of Treble and Bass Clefs Pendant © with Polishing Cloth	I got this for my daughter's birthday, as she'd been saying that she wanted a music-themed necklace.  It's very pretty, but the one pictured is better quality than what I got.  The soldering in person is a good bit more evident than in the image, and the silver itself isn't as smooth.  I'm considering replacing the chain because as someone else noted, it came already partially tangled and will probably continue to tangle with wear.<br /><br />Still very pretty an a lot more eye catching than most of the other musical note jewelry to be found, without being gaudy.  The polishing cloth is a small, but appreciated bonus.
Kitchen	Zipzicle Ice Pop Molds	Great for freezing fresh juice or fruit puree into healthy icee treats.
Jewelry	Titanium Domed Hawaiian Koa Wood Inlay Ring 8MM	Very light-weight ring, and the &#34;koa wood&#34; looked like a printed, pixelated picture.<br /><br />Alliteration aside, I will be returning this.

Kitchen	Presto 04212 4-in-1 Clock/Timer	I was going to send it back.  I did not realize it has a &#34;flim&#34; plastered over the display - it needs to be removed or you will not be able to see what you are doing!<br />Know that once you set the calendar, you can just toggle back and forth between 12 hr and 24 hr, which is nice.<br />I emailed cust service and they got back to me right away and gave me the phone # to call them if I still needed to.<br />Taking the protective film off eliminated by obvious problem, but I still had another question (12 vs. 24 hr clock).  So I called:  they answered on the first ring, then moved me to a queue and my wait was about 45 seconds.<br />TERRIFIC!<br />I bought two timers and knew I could send one back and get two of the same if I could only love one.  But I love them both:  this one and the Taylor one.

Jewelry	"Kenneth Cole New York ""Pebble Beach"" Mixed Bead Friendship Adjustable Bracelet"	Made well and I love it!
Kitchen	Hamilton Beach 22444 SmartToast Extra-Wide Slot Toaster	It doesn't get as hot as some cheaper slice toasters.  So you have to turn it all the way up in order to get a light char on your multi-grain toast. And it takes a lot longer to toast. The pros are that it's pretty compact, handles four slices, and is attractive.
Kitchen	Aroma Housewares ARC-914SBD Digital Cool-Touch Rice Cooker and Food Steamer,  8-Cup (Cooked), Silver	This thing works WAY TOO GOOD. The rice I steam is SOOO delicious and the steamed foods are DELICIOUS! I'm on my way to start cooking stews and soups in it! :)
Kitchen	Housweety Yarn/fiber/wool/string Ball Winder Hand-operated	Love using it, it gets the job done. I would have given 5 stars, but the arm that carries the yarn for the winder comes loose and falls in which I have to stop and fix it. Other than that it works great.
Kitchen	Kinetic GoGreen Classicor Wrought Iron Oval Pot Rack	Nuff said.
Kitchen	HomeFlav Kitchen Timer	I bought two of this kitchen timers and I'm so disappointed. It looks so cute but stop working after few days of use. So if you want as a decor in your kitchen it's fine but not for a timer. lol

Kitchen	Sun's Tea (TM) 9 oz Strong Double Wall Manhattan Style old-fashioned Vodka/Scotch/Whiskey Glasses, Set of 2	The packaging was superb, well protected, but not too bulky.  The glasses keep things colder longer and do not &#34;sweat&#34;.  The borosilicate has a different feel to it, but is quite nice after you get used to it.  I'll be buying more.

Kitchen	Pre-Programmed Digital Meat Thermometer - Instant Probe Read -5 BBQ Cooking Program - Dad Birthday Gift Idea	Works better than any cheap thermometer I've had, but it's still pretty slow.

Kitchen	OXO Good Grips Classic Tea Kettle, Brushed Stainless	I love this tea kettle! It is extremely well made. I like the style very much.  The burnished stainless steel exterior doesn't show water spots as easily as polished stainless steel.  I love the coated interior.  My well-water contains a lot of minerals and my last tea kettle's interior would be covered in lime within a week.  So far (almost a month of use), there isn't a spec of lime buildup.  The handle is high to make filling easy and the padding is comfortable to grip.  I only have one TINY gripe... the whistle is not as loud as my old kettle.  Nonetheless, I would not give up this tea kettle for any other.
Kitchen	Tupperware Sheerly Elegant Pitcher	it's my favorite pitcher
